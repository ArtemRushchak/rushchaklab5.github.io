			<p>American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails have released 11 studio albums, one live album, three remix albums, one box set, six extended plays, 20 singles, 10 promotional singles, four video albums and 31 music videos. Nine Inch Nails has also contributed to numerous film soundtracks as well as the soundtrack to the video game Quake.</p>

			<p>Initial ambitions for Nine Inch Nails in 1988 were to release one 12-inch single on a small European label. With the addition of future singles "Head Like a Hole" and "Sin", many of these demo tracks would later appear in revised form on the band's debut studio album, Pretty Hate Machine. The album was released in October 1989 and peaked at number 75 on the Billboard 200 the following year. In response to pressures from TVT Records for a follow-up to Nine Inch Nails' commercially successful debut, Reznor began recording the Broken extended play in secret. The EP was released in September 1992 and reached number seven on the Billboard 200. Nine Inch Nails' second studio album, The Downward Spiral (1994), reached number two on the Billboard 200 and has sold over four million copies in the United States, remaining the band's highest-selling release in the US.</p>

			<p>Five years elapsed before Nine Inch Nails' next major album, The Fragile, a double album that debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 228,000 copies in its first week, but dropped from the top 10 afterward.Another six years elapsed before Nine Inch Nails' next studio album, With Teeth, which also debuted atop the Billboard 200. In 2007, the band released their fifth studio album, Year Zero, alongside an accompanying alternate reality game.Reznor announced in late 2007 that Nine Inch Nails had fulfilled its contractual obligations with Interscope Records, and would distribute its next major album independently. The band's final Interscope release was a remix album based on material from Year Zero.The first Nine Inch Nails album released independently was the instrumental Ghosts Iâ€“IV in March 2008, followed two months later by The Slip. Hesitation Marks, the band's eighth studio album, was released in August 2013 through Columbia Records, reaching number three on the Billboard 200.After teasing a release in early 2016, Nine Inch Nails began releasing a trilogy of new releases: the EPs Not the Actual Events in December 2016 and Add Violence in July 2017, followed by the band's ninth studio album, Bad Witch, in June 2018. On March 26, 2020, the band released the albums Ghosts V: Together and Ghosts VI: Locusts.</p>
