					<p>Nine Inch Nails, commonly abbreviated as NIN and stylized as NIИ, is an American industrial rock band formed in 1988 in Cleveland, Ohio. Singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer Trent Reznor was the only permanent member of the band until the official addition of English musician Atticus Ross in 2016. The band's debut album, Pretty Hate Machine (1989), was released via TVT Records. After feuding with TVT about how to promote the album, Reznor signed with Interscope Records and released the EP Broken (1992). The following Nine Inch Nails albums, The Downward Spiral (1994) and The Fragile (1999), were released to critical acclaim and commercial success.</p>

					<p>Nine Inch Nails has sold over 20 million records and have been nominated for 13 Grammy Awards, winning for the songs "Wish" in 1992 and "Happiness in Slavery" in 1996. Time magazine named Reznor one of its most influential people in 1997, while Spin magazine once described him as "the most vital artist in music". In 2004, Rolling Stone placed Nine Inch Nails at No. 94 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time. Nine Inch Nails were nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, their first year of eligibility; they were nominated again in 2015 and 2020, with the latter resulting in an induction.</p>

	         Nine Inch Nails, an industrial rock band fronted by Trent Reznor, has toured all over the world since its creation in 1988.

In addition to regular concerts, the band has performed in both supporting and headlining roles at festivals such as Woodstock '94, Lollapalooza 1991 and 2008, and many other one-off performances including the MTV Video Music Awards.

               Nine Inch Nails’ Trent Reznor and his frequent collaborator and bandmate, Atticus Ross, have scored some of the biggest films, shows, and video games over the past decades. Now, two of NIN’s soundtracks – 2010’s The Social Network and the previously-unreleased score to the 1996 video game Quake – have been reissued on vinyl.
			   Declared to be “the best soundtrack ever created for a computer game” by GameSpot, the primarily ambient music for Quake was a labor of love for Trent Reznor, who was the sole member of NIN at the time. An avid fan of id Software’s games, Reznor not only composed the soundtrack but also produced the 1996 game’s sound effects.
